# KRename

KRename is a very powerful batch file renamer by KDE. It allows you to easily
rename hundreds or even more files in one go. The filenames can be created by
parts of the original filename, numbering the files or accessing hundreds of
information about the file, like creation date or Exif information of an
image. Its features include:

* renaming a list of files based on a set of expressions
* copying/moving a list of files to another directory
* convert filenames to upper/lower case
* adding numbers to filenames
* finding and replacing parts of the filename
* rename Mp3/Ogg Vorbis files based on their ID3 tags.
* setting access and modification dates
* permissions and file ownership
* a plug-in API which allows you to extend krename's features
* rename directories recursively
* support for KFilePlugins
* create undo file
* and many more...
